\chapter{Introduction and Notation}

The core difference between a Bayesian and a frenquencist is the belief on whether the latent or the parameter $\theta$ is a random variable or a constant. One of the major impacts is that iid assumptions changes to conditionally independent instead of mutually independent due to the connection between $\theta$ and $Y_i$ through the joint distribution $\bf{P}(Y_i, \theta_j)$
