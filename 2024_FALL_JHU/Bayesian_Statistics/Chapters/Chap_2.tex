\chapter{Multi-Parameter Models}
In the previous chapter, we introduced the idea of Bayesian Statistics, two one-parameter models, and one-parameter exponential family. In this chapter, we will go explore models with multiple parameters, together with some advanced ideas. 

\section{The most objective: Jeffreys' Prior}
When we are trying to select a prior, we often turn to the uniform distribution if we have no idea about how the parameters are distributed. Uniform is believed to be objective because all possible parameters are assigned with the same weight, meaning we are not favoring any particular options. But it's far from being perfect, because if so, this section won't exist. In this section, we will first explain why uniform can be problematic sometimes, and then introduce the Jeffreys' prior, which is believed to be more objective to some.
