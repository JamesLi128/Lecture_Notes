\chapter{Proximal Method}
In this chapter we will study proximal method which can be seen as a generalization of gradient descent. Before formally introduce the formulation, we will first describe a few examples and how the idea is developed. 

\section{Motivating Problems}
Many problems in real life can be ill-posed due to the lack of information. For example, in solving the linear system

\begin{equation*}
    Ax = b
\end{equation*}
It can be solved if
